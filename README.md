# Math Txt

Because math is fun.

To use, text to ''(415) 390-2014''.

Example txts:

 * `= $15 * 8.5%`
 * `sub pi from list`

## Requirements

 * Given a text like: add $15 to reed
   * Parse out add, $15 and reed, where $15 is the amount, add is the action and reed is the list. 
 * Be able to have shared lists and personal lists
 * Work without creating accounts, but also be able to tie accounts to phone numbers.
